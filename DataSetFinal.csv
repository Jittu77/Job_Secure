15.0,"Program Overview

The Low Carbon Development Initiative (LCDI) is a major undertaking by Indonesias Ministry of Planning (BAPPENAS) aimed to mainstream principles of sustainable development in policy making. It relies on the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA or KLHS), a methodological framework that pursues a change of paradigm away from an old unsustainable model of utilization of natural resources and of reliance on high carbon emission sources of energy; and into a new sustainable model that preserves the countrys vast natural capital base, while shifting towards renewable, low carbon sources of energy. The LCDI policies now has been incorporated in the National Medium Term Development Plan, so called RPJMN 2020-2024.

The analytical work of LCDI has offered insights not only on the actions for moving into a path of low carbon development, but also on the expected co-benefits derived from climate action. Results of the analysis show unequivocal gains in terms of value addition, employment, and welfare indicators, associated with a transition to low carbon systems and a growth model that preserves the countrys natural capital, including forests, biodiversity and water resources. Moreover, such gains can be expected to occur even in the short to medium term, in as much as actions identified under the LCDI are applied efficiently and with sufficient force and coherence, so that no trade-offs are generally expected from embracing low carbon policies.

New Climate Economy (NCE) and WRI Indonesia with funding support from the UKCCU has been supporting BAPPENAS since 2018 by providing expertise in analytics, engagement and communications on the economic-social-environmental nexus. The project collaborates with a variety of partners in Indonesia as well as internationally.

Beyond tangible ROI from working with us, the first-party data we collect puts publishers back in the driver's seat to better understand and index audience behavior and allows for extreme precision targeting for the brands we represent.

Insticator's engagement products are geared towards helping publishers establish a strong sense of social community within their ecosystems by enticing users to be more engaged with site content and amongst each other. OKO's ad monetization platform is the ultimate toolkit for publishers. And our newest sister company, Balihoo, supercharges digital media for franchise brands as the leader in multi-location marketing.

We collectively reach over 350 million consumers monthly across our network of premium publishers and advertisers, including Kohler, Pearle Vision, Trek, Ancestry, Investing Channel, Brit+Co, Evolve Media, and many more.

Stylumia believes in augmenting human intelligence in fashion and lifestyle retail for a better world. With relevant data and the right technology, people and businesses in fashion and lifestyle retail can solve challenging problems and change the world for the better. In 2015-16, when we looked at the available technology and solutions, we saw fashion forecasting and demand planning are either subjective in nature. We saw these methods do not solve the fundamental challenge in fashion trend spotting, trend forecast, and the business metrics of full-price sell-through continue to remain around the 50% mark creating over USD 750 billion/annum of wastage globally. The biggest wastage in the fashion industry is the one caused by ill-informed decision-making. We saw a need for a different kind of technology and approach, and we knew it would need a different kind of company to build it. That is why we formed Stylumia, a Deep Tech company solving fundamental retail challenges. Stylumia is a global innovation-first Retail AI organisation. We have products that impact the daily lives of varying multi-disciplinary personas across the value chain as we strive to help them eliminate wastage in the industry, by augmenting their decisions with consumer-backed insights.

About Us
When Petpooja’s first avatar came into being in 2011, it was a simple B2B food delivery model that took bulk food orders from the corporates & passed them forward to the restaurants. But soon, our founders realised that the restaurants they worked with were not living up to their potential and were shutting down forever. Primarily it was due to a lack of coherent technology that could support their daily operations. Their billing machines were as bulky, tedious and old as time. Due to this, the restaurants never had an actual estimate of their profit margins & expenses. Back then, restaurants were suffering more than growing.

This was when our founders decided to build a robust, user-friendly & cost-effective billing software for SMB restaurants that will automate everyday operations and push businesses towards sustainability.

And now, a decade into the industry, we have realized our dream of becoming the ideal restaurant billing solution provider to all & every kind of food service business in India.
Why Us?
Join the Petpooja Family!

About Sitetracker
Sitetracker was founded ten years ago with the singular focus of solving a problem that was first recognized within the telecommunications industry; how to effectively manage the volume, variety, and velocity of critical infrastructure projects needed to meet the demand of expanding wireless and cellular service. That problem has become even more pronounced due to the eventual explosion of 5G. Being able to effectively deploy infrastructure is going to be the differentiator between leading telecommunication providers.
However, over the years, we realized that this challenge isn’t localized to telecommunications – it’s pervasive nearly everywhere and has reached an inflection point. Utilities (such as gas and electric services), smart cities, and alternative energy all face similar challenges. Sitetracker is the only full-lifecycle project management platform suited to support these companies and address these challenges.
We are exceptionally proud of the company we’ve built (we were recently recognized as the #2 place to work in San Francisco, as well as one of the top places to work in the entire United States). Our people are extraordinary and we’re continuing to invest in our people-first culture.",1,3,0,0,0,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,4,1

0.0,"Data Scientist: A data scientist is a professional who analyzes and interprets complex data sets to inform business decision-making. This role combines expertise in statistics, mathematics, programming, and domain-specific knowledge to extract meaningful insights from large and unstructured data.
Here are key aspects of a data scientist’s role:
Data Analysis and Interpretation: Data scientists work with vast amounts of data, using statistical methods and machine learning techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations. They derive actionable insights from the data to help organizations make informed decisions.
Programming and Data Manipulation: Proficiency in programming languages such as Python or R is crucial for a data scientist. They use these languages to manipulate and analyze data, create models, and build algorithms.
Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling: Data scientists often apply machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models. These models can be used to forecast future trends, identify potential opportunities, or predict outcomes.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Before analysis, data scientists must clean and preprocess raw data to ensure its quality and relevance. This may involve handling missing values, addressing outliers, and transforming data into a suitable format.
Communication of Results: Effectively communicating findings to non-technical stakeholders is a critical aspect of the job. Data scientists present their insights using data visualization tools and reports, making complex information accessible to decision-makers.
Collaboration: Data scientists often work in interdisciplinary teams, collaborating with business analysts, domain experts, and other professionals. This collaboration helps ensure that data-driven insights align with organizational goals and strategies.
Continuous Learning: Given the rapidly evolving nature of data science and technology, data scientists engage in continuous learning to stay updated on new tools, techniques, and industry trends.
Salary: As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, the salary of a data scientist can vary based on several factors, including experience, education, geographic location, industry, and the specific company. Data scientists generally command competitive salaries due to the specialized skills and expertise required for the role.On average, in the United States, entry-level data scientists might earn a median salary ranging from $80,000 to $120,000 per year. Mid-level data scientists with a few years of experience can earn salaries in the range of $100,000 to $150,000 or more.
